    """
    Attempts to refine the global membership vector for graph g by applying community_multilevel 
    at a common resolution (starting at base_resolution + dr) for all communities.
    
    For each unique community in current_membership, the induced subgraph is extracted and 
    community_multilevel is run at resolution 'new_res'. This new_res is increased (by dr) 
    until at least one community is split nontrivially (i.e. the induced subgraph yields more 
    than one group) or max_resolution is reached.
    
    If any community is refined, the global membership is updated for those vertices by concatenating 
    the parent's label with the sub-community label (separated by an underscore).
